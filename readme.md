# my csc website

hi!

this is just where i can keep track of changes that I make. mostly there is no plan.
except for that there is somewhat of a plan.

### plan part 1:

all the stuff i wrote on the index page, about putting neopets stuff there.
i think it'd still be very nice for me to do that.

### plan part 2:

the in the groove stuff! all the stuff in and around itg2/

this stuff is all mostly just a me-pretending-to-do-my-own groovestats.com.
so all the scores there are mine, or from my usb sticks. wah wah wah.

there are a couple of branches for that.

#### database stuff

wouldn't that be cool? to make it be a real really real database?

#### javascript/frontendy stuff

wouldn't THAT be cool? an actually cool visualization stuff?
and also can work with the database maybe even??? who knows.

#### caching or something

wouldn't THAAT be cool? yeah. maybe.
idk. we'll see.
